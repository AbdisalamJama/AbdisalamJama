- 👋 Hi, I’m @AbdisalamJama a 4th year Msci Physics student who focuses on Theortical Particle Physics and Astrophysics.
- 👀 I’m interested in using mathematical modelling and numerical modelling to create models of real-life phonema and explore the differences and predicitons that entails.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on an untitled project on Particle Physics and Astrophysics. Most of my projects are either in Python or Matlab, however I do work on other programming Languages.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on Particle Physics projects.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to Fish and go on Hikes. My "current" goal is to visit the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National park located in Colorado, USA. A longer term goal is to do a road-trip across all American states
- however, that will be hard.
